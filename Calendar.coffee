# Calendar was built to test a strategy to animate periods that might not be continous as a prototype for
# skyviews in Time.
# Eg. Animating from [2020, 2021, 2022] to [2021, 2022, 2023] is quite obvious since you just use the years
#	for flipKey as "2021,2022,2023" and also the years for flipId's.
# It's trickier to go from [2020, 2021, 2022] to [2025, 2026, 2027] since if you use the years for flipId's
# none of the new years [2025, 2026, 2027] has been rendered already so they will just appear without being
# animated.
# One solution could be to first render 2025, 2026 and 2027 to the right and then animate them in, but it's
# unnessecary renderings and will require two render step.
# The chosen solution is to always render 3 panels with arbitrary flipId's (starting from -1, 0, 1). If you
# want the panels to animate left you just add 1 and to animate right subtract 1.
# The content of the panels is not tied to the flipId's, but instead we keep a list of what content should
# actually be rendered in the years array. [null, 2021, null] means 2021 is rendered in the middle and both
# the left and right panels are empty. If we want to increase 1 year we just add 1 to the arbitrary items
# so the panels animate left and setYears to [2021, 2022, null].
# If we want to move many years we do the same; add 1 to items and setYears to [2021, 2026, null] to see the
# animation from 2021 to 2026.
# It seems to work well, but not yet tested on weeks in skyview.
